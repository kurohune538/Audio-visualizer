# Purpose
I want to make an interactive audio visualizer. Because audio visualizer includes some part of VJ and DJ elements.
So If I make the interactive audio visualizer, I can play VJ and DJ with other audience.

## ICM-prj1
At first, I made an audio visualizer itself.
First of all, I use `p5.FFT()` for detecting the frequency values of sound.
I use trigonometric function for mapping the FFT values to circular visualizer.
